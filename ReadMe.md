# lavender_mist 

lavender_mist is a series of visualization procedures that seperated from lavender, a pure python-based Lagrangian dispersion model.

**NOTE:** For the 3D Renderer, it has been tested that python 3.8 with matplotlib 3.4.3 is much faster (8X) than python 3.10 with matplotlib 3.7.1.
